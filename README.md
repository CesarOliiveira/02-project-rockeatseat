# Project Ignite Rockeat Seat course.
## React + TypeScript

Project made in the Rocketseat course.

The project consists of creating a functional timer, where you can set a title and a duration for the start of the countdown.
These input values will be added to the application's history, where you can also see if the timer has been completed, stopped, or if it is still in progress.
